I'm currently studying React at CanSheCode school. My main job is legal, but programming is my passion, my hobby. Together with the CanSheCode school, I took my first conscious steps in development, although I also have a degree in software engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
